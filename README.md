# Stranger Things 🎬

One of my all-time favorite series is **Stranger Things** on Netflix. It’s a mix of *sci-fi*, *horror*, and *adventure* set in the 80s, and it really nails that nostalgic vibe. The story follows a group of kids in the small town of Hawkins who discover some pretty creepy supernatural stuff happening around them — all starting with the mysterious disappearance of one of their friends.
